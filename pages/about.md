# Hello, I'm Scott Scoble

Welcome to my personal site! I'm a seasoned DevOps professional based in Henderson, Nevada. With over a decade of experience, I've been greasing the wheels of development through QA, CI/CD, DevOps, and more.

## Professional Background

I'm currently working at b.well Connected Health, where I apply my expertise in DevOps practices to streamline development processes and enhance software delivery. My journey in the tech world has been diverse and exciting, allowing me to work on various aspects of software development and operations.

## Skills and Expertise

- DevOps practices and methodologies
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Quality Assurance (QA)
- Software Development
- Cloud Technologies
- Automation

## Projects and Contributions

Throughout my career, I've worked on several interesting projects:

1. **Rooted Emailer**: A tool to help my volunteer team of Rooted facilitators manage their participants and email templates.
2. **ic-tools**: A Nix flake providing tooling to build on the Internet Computer.
3. **My Resume**: I manage my resume using LaTeX, Jinja2, and Nix, continuously built and delivered by a Github Action workflow.
4. **GoChefIt web application**: A microservice application built for and ran on AWS infrastructure.

You can find more of my work on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/wscoble), where I've contributed to various open-source projects and shared some of my personal developments.

## Volunteer Experience

I'm passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteer at The Crossing Christian Church as an IT and Spiritual Development Volunteer, where I serve as a Rooted Facilitator and contribute to the IT department.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in the world of DevOps and software development, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry.
